# Rules of Leduc poker

- Leduc is a simplified form of limit Texas hold’em poker, played with a deck of just 6 cards (two suits, three cards in each).
- Each player receives one private card and there is one shared community card.
- There are two rounds of betting, one before the community card is revealed and one after.
- In each round of betting, players have three options: fold, call, or raise.
- The maximum number of raises is capped at four per round.
- The player with the best hand (using a simplified poker hand ranking) at the end of the second round wins the pot.
